      comment: "I booked a 3 days tour to Amboseli National Park last month with Danil Scenic Tours and to-date I still have nostalgia. It was my first tour experience I must say I enjoyed every moment. The itinerary was well planned and the pricing was pocket friendly. The accommodation was at Kibo Safari Camp and everything about the camp was perfect from meals, bed and staff. During the tour the guide was not only friendly but also very knowledgeable about birds, animals, culture of the Masai people. The best part about the whole tour was my birthday surprise by the team from Danil Scenic Tours (thanks to their keen eye for detail they noticed from my identification documents that I had a birthday on the last day of the tour). Let me tell it to you, they actually organized with the hotel for me to cut a piece of cake as they sang birthday songs walking round the dinning area and using cutlery as the musical instruments.... wow, this was so emotional I could not help it. This was best birthday that I have ever celebrated in my life. Thank you Danil Scenic Tours for that and the whole team good job. I plan to do another trip with them soon.üòç",

      comment: "I recently had the pleasure of embarking on a safari adventure to the iconic Maasai mara national reserve with Danil scenic tours and it was nothing short of extra ordinary. From the time I booked my safari with them, they team demonstrated professionalism and expertise. They provided a detailed information about the itinerary, accommodation and what to expect during the safari. The game drives were incredible and had an opportunity of viewing the animals in their natural habitat. The overall experience exceeded my expectations, the combination of expert guidance, unforgettable wildlife encounters and seamless logistics made it a trip of a lifetime. I wouldn't hesitate recommending Danil scenic Tours to anyone seeking an authentic and unforgettable safari experience.",

      comment: "I recently had the opportunity to embark on a journey with Danil Scenic Tours through Kenya, and it was truly an unforgettable experience. From start to finish, the trip was incredibly well-organized, and I was impressed by the attention to detail and professionalism of the tour guides. Throughout the journey, I learned so much about the culture, history, and wildlife of Kenya. The accommodations provided by Danil Scenic Tours were top-notch, offering comfort and luxury in the heart of nature. Despite the many activities packed into each day, everything ran smoothly, and I never felt rushed or overwhelmed. Additionally, the warmth and hospitality of the local people left a lasting impression on me, making me feel truly welcomed and at home. Overall, my experience with Danil Scenic Tours exceeded all expectations. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for an enriching and immersive travel experience in Kenya.",

We booked a tour to Lake Nakuru National Park with Danil Scenic Tour and the package they offered was budget friendly. Dan the tour guide was amazing. He knew the park like the back of his hands and was able to locate lots of animals. He explained about their characteristics, what they eat, gestation period and lifespan. Looking forward to having more game drives with Danil in the near future.",

      comment: "Arriving in an unknown continent, we felt immediately at ease with Dan. He is an experienced guide who knows the country, the interaction with people and the way things are done in Kenia. This gave us great peace of mind and allowed us to fully enjoy our trip. We didn‚Äôt have to worry about anything, if an issue arose, he would solve it without us needing to stay on top of things. Besides that, he has years of experience travelling the national parks so he knows where to find the animals and how to decipher the codes used by other guides telling each other where the animals are located over the car radio‚Äôs. On top of that he is respectful towards the animals, acknowledging the rules of the parks, always shutting down the car engine as soon as the car is at a standstill and allowing you as much time with an animal as you want. By consequence we saw the big 5 by day 2 of our trip and so many more beautiful animals that we are still over the moon just by thinking back on our trip. Dan will always make sure your trip is exactly what you like it to be, he wants you to be straight and clear about your expectations so that he can do his best to make them happen. For us European travellers (aged 35 and 72) that was a relief since we appreciate honesty and bluntness rather than excuses and attempts to smoothen issues. If any of my friends or family wanted to go for a safari in Kenia, I would advise Dan without second thought. He is a person with the heart in the right place and someone you can really trust in an unknown environment, which is what we appreciated the most.",

For example, on the last day back to Nairobi city, there was still several demonstrations in the center, so Dan actively confirmed the status in the city to make sure our safety. Beyond that, he sadly got fever during our safari, but he kept sticking with our original plan which really warmed us a lot, and even not lost any feelings of animals searching. The Contact staff was also amazing, she was so patient with our requirements and questions so we could have a wonderful safari in Kenya.",
